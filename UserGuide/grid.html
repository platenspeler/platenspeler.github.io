<h1>LamPI Tiles screen</h1>
<p>As an alternative user interface to the rooms, scenes and timers screen I developed the &quot;tiles&quot; grid interface. It is currently in beta. The tile interface in a way resembles the metro type of interface that is present on Windows systems today.</p>
<p><a href="screenshots/tile_screen_01.JPG"><img src="screenshots/tile_screen_01.JPG" width="666" height="444"></a></p>
<p>The tiles interface is a so-called grid interface with widgets of same or different sizes that all contain a specific function.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are several actions possible on the widgets:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Click and Move. By selecting the widgets, they can be moved over the grid</li>
  <li>Double click on the widget on a PC to enlarge that widget and at the same time &quot;freeze&quot; the user interface for dragging widgets
    <ul>
      <li>It is TBD whether we will show more options on the enlarged widgets</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Resizing the widgets is possible on the lower right corner of the widget</li>
  <li>All actions that below to the widget content are also possible.
    <ul>
      <li>Switching on a off</li>
      <li>Dimming</li>
      <li>Other specific actions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h1>Mobile</h1>
<p>Of course there is a mobile version available as well (based on jQuery Mobile). This interface on the PC looks almost the same but it will look much better on the screen of a mobile device.</p>

<h1>How to activate tiles</h1>
<p>The tiles interface is currently activated by &quot;http://&lt;your-IP&gt;/grid&quot; but this may change in the future when we integrate tiles into the standard LamPI-xx.yy.js GUI.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Selecting and Filtering</h1>
<p>Three types of items can be selected for the grids:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Devices</li>
  <li>Scenes</li>
  <li>Sensors</li>
</ul>
<p>It does not make sense to have timers, rules and settings included in this list as they are not local</p>
<h1>Sorting</h1>
<p>The second row in the header section definces the way that the tiles can be sorted on the screen. There are 4 selections and we probably will not add more as this will destroy the mobile experience.</p>
<ul>
  <li>No sorting, so items are displayed in order that have in te database and as they are selected by &quot;selecting and filtering&quot;</li>
  <li>Sort in locations; based on the rooms that the devices are in we do sorting.</li>
  <li>Sort on type of the widget objects: So put all devices together, sensors and scenes</li>
  <li>Sort the selected items in alphabetical&nbsp;order (on name)</li>
</ul>
