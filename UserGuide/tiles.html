<h1>LamPI Tiles screen</h1>
<p>As an alternative user interface to the rooms, scenes and timers screen I developed the &quot;tiles&quot; screen interface. It is currently in beta. Th etiles interface in a way resembles the metro type of interface that is present on Windows systems today.</p>
<p>The tiles interface is a so-called grid interface with widgets of same or different sizes that all contain a specific function.&nbsp;For example</p>
<h1>How to activate tiles</h1>
<p>The tiles interface is currently activated by &quot;http://&lt;your-IP&gt;/grid&quot; but this may change in the future should we integrate tiles into the standard LamPI-xx.yy.js GUI.</p>
