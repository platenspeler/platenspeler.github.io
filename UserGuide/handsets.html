<p>(This is a grey skin)</p>
<p>Te handset screen allows you to connect your own handset of klikaanklikuit, action, kopou or Livolo to the system. As most handsets (remote controllers) have at least 4 buttons and some can even control 16 devices (OP and OFF), the list can be as long as 32 positions or even more. This is because the administrator can assign an number of (scene) actions to one button.</p>
