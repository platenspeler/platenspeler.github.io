<h1>Grid system</h1>
<p>As an alternative for teh standard LamPI layout we looked at&nbsp;a grid system that could server the GUI elements of LamPI. It would need to show the sitwhces, dimmers, thermostats and sensors in a tile which would then enable the user to filter and sort this environment.</p>
<p>Ideally, when double clicking the tile, the user then would be able to change the valu of the underlying element.</p>
<h1>What to choose</h1>
<p>We see several examples of grid based systems at the moment in for example Metrod (window 8), Google+, Office on-line, Pinterst etc, Although these tile-grid&nbsp;systems are becoming more and more popular in commercial systems, it is hard to choose one in a non-commercial hobby environment. As always, we hope that the plug-in or library is of high quality, it-s use if free or unlimited for our purpose and it is maitaned over a logger time. It would also be nice if we get some sort of support from the developer should anything go wrong.</p>
<p>The ones to choose from (at the moment) are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Masonry</li>
  <li>isotope (also commercial)</li>
  <li>Shapeshift</li>
  <li>gridster</li>
  <li>gridstack</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
<h2>Masonry</h2>
<p>Made by @desandro, who also made Isotope.</p>
<h2>Isotope</h2>
<p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
  <li>Seems to be atively supported</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>For commercial use one need to buy a license</li>
</ul>
<h2>Shapeshift</h2>
<p>Shapeshift is one of the smaller companies in the row. Shapeshift is made by &quot;we the media&quot;. Unfortunately it seems like they are inactive now for a while (since 2013) and the webside referred to on gridhub does not work anymore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Gridster</h2>
<p>Advantages of Gridster</p>
<ul>
  <li>Completely free to use</li>
  <li>Resizable</li>
  <li>Draggable</li>
</ul>
<p>Most important drawbacks of Gridster are:<br />
</p>
<ul>
  <li>No automatic resizing of the grid if the screen&nbsp;is resized</li>
  <li>Performance problems if we create large amount of widgets</li>
  <li>Documentation is not simple and lacks examples</li>
  <li>Support of 'Ducksboard' has stopped since they are bought by another company</li>
</ul>
<h2>Gridstack</h2>
<p>By Pavel Reznikov</p>
<p>According to the git site, Gridstack is inspired by Gridster. Interface looks more or less the same and probably gridster code can be ported to gridstack without too much of a hasle.</p>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Looks like gridster successor</li>
  <li>Issues seem to be addressed and there is acive support</li>
  <li>Dynamic</li>
  <li>Resizeable</li>
  <li>Draggable</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
  <li>Not so many peope following (yet)</li>
</ul>
