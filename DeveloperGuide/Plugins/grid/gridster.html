<h1>Gridster</h1>
<p>As an alternative for teh standard LamPI layout we looked at&nbsp;a grid system that could server the GUI elements of LamPI. It would need to show the switches, dimmers, thermostats and sensors in a tile which would then enable the user to filter and sort this environment.</p>
<p>Ideally, when double clicking the tile, the user then would be able to change the valu of the underlying element.</p>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<h2>Getting started with Gridster</h2>
<p>Gridster is best initialised by making all definitions of the grid on a&nbsp;page in html and then start making all the logic. Unfortunately, the amount of tiles/widgets needed by LamPI is dynamic and therefore we use the Javascript interface to dynamically build the gris. This has the disadvantage that gridster recalculates the css after EVERY widgets added to the system an that takes a lot of time. </p>
<p>Better would have been if we could switch that off, add all widgets to the system and then recaculate once the css for all widgets.</p>
