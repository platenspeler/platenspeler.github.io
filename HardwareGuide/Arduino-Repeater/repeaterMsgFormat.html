<h1>Arduino Repeater messaging</h1>
<h5>Version 3.6 Alpha; Message format may (and will) probably change between LamPI releases</h5>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>When using the Arduino as a repeater for 433MHz messages,&nbsp;the board will pick up ANY well-known 433MHz communication and when a sensor is recognized will retransmit it over the air. There are a few&nbsp;specials which make the Arduino Repeater even more attractive:</p>
<h2>Message Format</h2>
<ul>
  <li>REPEAT: The WT440 and other well-known messages are repeated without handling, Other receiver types are not yet integrated</li>
  <li>CONVERT: Auriol messages are handled differently, their protocol is &quot;translated&quot; to the well-known WT440 message format as described on the 433messaging page. (In fact we make the Auriol known as a WT440 device (no humidity).</li>
  <li>TRANSMIT: On-board repeater sensors of type Dallas (ds18b20), HTU21, BMP085/BMP180 will be transmitted over the air AS-IF it were WT440 devices. Airpressure of BMP085 will be coded so that the receiving Arduino Gateway can correctly work with its values.</li>
  <li>CONFIGURE: All sensors or receiver types can be enabled/disabled at compile time by editing the 433Repeater.h file.</li>
</ul>
