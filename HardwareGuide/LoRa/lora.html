 <h1>LoRa IOT</h1>
<p>Internet of Things (IoT) is hot today. There are multiple uses for Internet of Things sensors, most of them we did not even think of today.&nbsp;It is possible to build IoT sensors and devices based on well-known technology such as (1) home technology based on 433MHz devices for example or (2) use WiFi in your home or business to have the IoT connect to the rest of the internet. And of course it is possible to use (3) a mobile network as carrier for your IoT implementation</p>
<p>However, The first technology is often limited by range of the transmitters and receivers as these are vulnarable to interference.&nbsp;On the other hand, they are potentially energy efficient which makes them suitable for battery use for a longer period of time (2 years or so)</p>
<p>Also Wifi based IoT has the advantage of more range as we have Wifi in most homes and businessess today, but it also suffers from some drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Wifi is not very energy efficient so battery-operated sensors and devices are difficult</li>
  <li>IoT devices cannot be moved from one location to the other so easily as they &quot;connected&quot; themselves to WiFi access points with their own SSID and passwords.</li>
  <li>It has more speed than necessary (which is not really a drawback).</li>
</ul>
<p>Important for a successful and quick roll-out of IoT is the availablility of enough &quot;gateways&quot;</p>

<h1>So what is LoRa</h1>
<p>LoRa is a new standard for long range (LoRa) communication. LoRa is a mix of type 1 and type 3 communication: It makes use of public band transmissions (in NL on 868MHz) but with a far better protocol which is much better shielded against outside interference. And it makes use of some sort of public network as well with gateways that handle 20,000 connections overing a range of 5Km.</p>
<p>But as &quot;Things&quot; do not need a bandwith of several MBytes/s and transmite most of the times we do not need the 3G or 4G networks. In fact, these would be far too expensive. therefore a separate network is installed for IoT that offers less bandwidth, long range, less power and enough security.</p>
<p>IoT messages are assumed to be short and transmission would take place once every minute or so. So LoRa sensors would be able to work on batteries for an extended period of time.</p>

<p>The Dutch KPN started with loRa in November 2015 in the cities Rotterdam and the Hague. In other cities in the Netherlands the thingsnetwork has started free initiatives in cities like Amsterdam&nbsp;and Eindhoven.</p>

<h1>loRa Gateway</h1>
<p>If you're not living in or close to one of the cities where thethingsnetwork or KPN LoRa is already installed, you need&nbsp;to buy your own gateway in order to start with the IoT.</p>
