<h1>Arduino Gateway</h1>
<p>As I explained elsewhere in the documentation, I decided to off-load the Raspberries with all transmitter/receiver work and use Arduin's for that purpose. Arduino's are relatively easy to progran, their additional cost is next to nothing and since they do not have the overhead of a Linux OS, their real-time behaviour out of the box is much better than that of a Raspberry.</p>
<h2>Nano Gateway</h2>
<p>The first version(s) of the gateway were based on the Arduino Nano as the engine of the gateway. The Nano has 32KBytes of memory which is surprisingly much when we're looking at all the C-code necessary for libraries and program sketches.</p>

<p>I made three versions for use in our house: One for every floor that we need covered by sensors and/or devices. Below you see the second sensor.</p>

<p>As you ca see in the picture above I found a nice enclosure box for the Arduino Gteway. I'm not sure I will use it though, as despite my efforts to get a good airflow in the box the temperature sensor reading is more than 3 degrees higher than tht of an environmental sensor that is not in a box. </p>

<p>Although the Nano proves to be sufficient for most cases, especially for mine, when having&nbsp;I2C and Dallas sensors as well the nano runs out of memory quickly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Mega Gateway</h2>
<p>In order to get more program memory than the Nano, I decided to buy a Mega. The mega has MUCH more memory and will allow implementation of almost all protocols without problems. That does not mean however that it is smart to enable all supported receivers at the same time: Not memory time to handle all protocols in an interrupt cycle would be a problem.</p>
<p>So what can we do now with the Mega that we could not do before with the Arduino Nano? Good questions. As I said, I normally would not need&nbsp;the additional memory for the following reasons.</p>
<ul>
  <li>With conditional compilation (#ifdef) I would only enable the code that I would really use. Especially necessary to restrict the number of 433MHz receivers that the gateway would enable and listen for. In your (and my) house you will probably use only a subset of all supported receiver devices. Of course using dynamic setting on/off of these receivers is most sexy. However, making this decision at compile time makes MUCH more sense.</li>
  <li>Do not enable all sensors that are potentially supported on your Arduino Gateway. One sensor per gateway will in general be enough (I2C sensor HTU21d for example.) And do not use two sensors with different bus technology as that would require two different bus/stacks to be loaded.&nbsp;So if you need more sensors, do not enable Dallas sensors, but choose a few I2C sensors.<br />
    For example: Disabling Dallas sensors made memory usage drop from 28,881 bytes to 26,096 bytes. So 10% memory save by disabling not used sensors at compile time.<br />
  </li>
  <li>If&nbsp; possible, do not use sensors on your Arduino gateway at all but use separate Arduino Sensor device.</li>
</ul>
<p>OK, having said all those sensible things, I could imagine that you want the Arduino Mega because it would allow&nbsp;more error and diagnostic help messages, check for all kind of&nbsp;conditions and allow real-time configuration of enabled sensors and message receivers. Also you can use the Mega to implement better administration features, something that the Nano just does NOT have the memory support for.</p>
<p>As said, for my own use I do not really need it, except when building stuff and not need to worry about memory usage in the first place. And also, I like to keep the version for the Mega a superset of the standard version, so all library functions and supported protocols should work on both versions, and only administartion and real-time information should be different.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What mega</h3>
<p>For the development version I bough the standard version of Ebay for around 7 Euro. however, I like the new Arduino 2560 Pro-Mini a lot and probably I will use that version for production version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Message Format</h2>
<p>The message format of messages exchanged between the Raspberry and the Arduino Gateway is defined <a href="gatewayMsgFormat.html">on the following page(s)</a>. Because the Arduino is very limited in memory, the messages exchanged are integer encoded and therefore rather simple.</p>
<p>If there is any more descriptive messaging needed, we do it on the host side and can make an interface like the Serial Monitor to interface the Arduino especially for LamPI.</p>
