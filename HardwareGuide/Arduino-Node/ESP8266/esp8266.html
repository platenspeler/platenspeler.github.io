 <h1>ESP 8266 IOT Sensor</h1>
<p>A new variant of the Arduino battery powered node is the IOT sensor which is based on a Wifi node such as the ESP8266.</p>
 <h2>8266 famility</h2>
 <p>There are several types of ESP 8266 boards available. They differ in the amount of IO channels/pins available to the use. I do have the ESP-01 version which is the simplest and cheapest form with only 2 IO ports. As a result, pin out is different as well and often these more powerful ESP boards to not have 2.54mm spacing which makes connecting these boards more difficult.</p>
