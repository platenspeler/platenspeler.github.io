<h1>Arduino Node</h1>
<p>Ever since the&nbsp;first Arduino Gateway, there was the idea to build a &quot;network&quot; of wireless nodes so that the Arduino could communicate on a higher level with the Raspberry master and its slaves and send sensor information etc. to the host.</p>
<p>The RadioHead library provides reliable, addressed but also unreliable communication over the air on a number of frequencies depending on the transceiver used. This means that we can use more or less teh same code regardless of the underlying hardware transceiver technology used.</p>
<p>So what would be the purposed of having such a network in the house</p>
<ul>
  <li>Send sensor data in a reliable and standard way over the air to the LamPI-node daemon</li>
  <li>Act as an intermediate &quot;node&quot; in the network and extensing its range in the mesh topology</li>
</ul>
<p>Experimenting </p>
