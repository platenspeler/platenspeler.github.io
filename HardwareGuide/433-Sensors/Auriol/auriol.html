<h1>Temperature Sensor Auriol</h1>
<p>The Auriol receiver is part of a cheap weather station package that is sold by (for example) LIDL in the Netherlands. The outside sensor will only measure temperature and not humidity (as do most other nowadays). The advantage of the Auriol sensor is that it is cheap, small and it has a good range (better than the wt-400h sensor).</p>
<p>So the Arduino section contains support for this sensor and if neessay it is possible to use the Arduino Repeater setup to receive Auriol temperature and convert it and transmit it further as  the well-known wh440h protocol.</p>
<p>The protocol description of the Auriol sensor is found on the <a href="../../Arduino-Gateway/gatewayMsgFormat.html">gatewayMsgFormat.html</a> page in the Hardware Guide, or when using an Arduino Repeater it is found on the <a href="../../Arduino-Repeater/repeaterMsgFormat.html">repeaterMsgFormat.html</a> page.</p>
