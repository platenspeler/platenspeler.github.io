<h1>Wired Sensors</h1>
<p>This part of the documentation describes the sensors interface. With sensors
  we mean devices that are physically connected/attached to the Raspberry&nbsp; to one
  of the GPIO pins. So they are connected with a physical wire. Sensors typically
  are temperature/humidity interfaces or energy sensors.</p>
<p>What makes sensors different from the &quot;normal&quot; receivers: The
  latter operate asynchronously and begin to send as they like it. The connected
  wire sensors will only start once they receive a command over the line from the
  MCU (Micro Controlling Unit aka Raspberry).</p>
<p>For the sake of simplicity, I like to categorize wired sensors in the
  following groups:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="no_bus_sensors.html">Sensors without a bus mechanism, so every sensor might have its own
    protocol and will be connected to a free GPIO pin</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="dallas_sensors.html">Single- or One-Wire sensors with Dallas bus protocol</a></li>
  <li><a href="i2c_sensors.html">Two-wire sensors on the I2C bus</a></li>
  <li><a href="energy_sensors.html">Energy sensors, connected to the  P1 bus of your Smart Meter</a></li>
</ol>
