<h1>Itho Ventilator</h1>
<p>In our home, like most other homes in the Netherlands we have a central ventilation unit. It is made by Itho/Daalderop (Schiedam) and it is a box of 350x355x294 mm with one output and several (configurable) inputs that manages the ventilation in the home. The type is CVE-ECO-v2 (typenr: 545-5024) with optional receiver (typenr 536-0130)</p>
<p>At this moment the unit is managed using a remote wireless transmitter that has 4 buttons in the bathroom. Here you can set the unit on 3 possible&nbsp;ventilation speeds and it has a fourth button to select a timer.</p>
<p>As an option for the new CFT models as of 2012 Itho sells a 536-0102 optional I2C-PWM optional board. Unfortunately this board does not fit in my unit, and therefore we need to make our own transmitter...</p>
