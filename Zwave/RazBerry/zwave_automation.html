<h1>Razberry Automation</h1>
<p>The Z-way automation interface is an API that allows programming the Z-Way interface with Javascript programs.</p>
<h2>Notifications/Callbacks</h2>
<p>The UI web interface described above comes in very handy if we want to get or set the status of a particular device. However, it does not allow us to receive a status update of one of the connected devices. For example, if the user would use a wall switch to switch a lamp, the LamPI software would not know this. Of course we can check the status of a LamPI every now and then but this requires more compute power as we normally want.</p>
<p>There are several interfaces available to manage the Z-Way software on.</p>
<h2>Links and Documentation</h2>
<p>I copied some documents from the Z-Wave.me website for no other reason than mae them easy to find and keep versions used for LamPI available even if on-line documentation would change.</p>
