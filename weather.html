<h1>Weather sensor support</h1>
<p>This part of the documentation describes the weather screen and what you can (and sometimes cannot) do with weather sensors. Since version 1.8 LamPI does support weather station sensors. At first only the UPM WT440H (outdoor) sensor is supported and it works fine. Other snesors can be added to the LamPI-receiver/sniffer program later, but it is good to know that the LamPI-daemon offers support for receiving Json messages from weather sensors.</p>

<h1>Json message</h1>
<p>The Json message that is sent to the LamPI-daemon is as follows:</p>
<p>message = {<br>
tcnt : integer,<br>
type : 'json',<br>
action : 'weather',<br>
brand: wt440h 	# or other supported brand<br>
address: integer, # (house code)<br>
channel: integer,<br>
temperature: integer.integer<br>
humidity: intteger,<br>
windspeed: integer,<br>
winddirection: integer, # in degrees<br>
rain : integer # (mm per hour)</p>
<p>}; <br>
</p>
<h1>Adding a new Weather sensor</h1>
<p>Weather sensors can be added to the LamPI-receiver by making a sensor function in C and including it in the receiver.c file and in the Makefile.</p>
