<h1>Hue Installation</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Not long ago (February 2019) I decided to change most of my klikaanklikuit devices to Hue. This was because I neede a more reliable home automation protocol which offeren bi-directional communication so that one can see whether devices are switched on or off. Of course I already had several Z-Wave devices and it looked like&nbsp;an easy choice to get everything to Z-Wave, however there were reasons to gu to Zigbee protocol.</p>
<ul>
  <li>First of all, I wanted a reliable protocal with built-in apps etc. Z-Wave was not reliable in my setup and I did not want to by a highly overprices bridge to be able to control my devices. The Hue products are a no-brainer and work out of the box</li>
  <li>Z-Wave was completely different in that it had devices built in switches and dimmers in the wall, whereas hue semed to have everything buitl in Lamps. Fortunately, hue friends were starting to offer the first&nbsp;modules hat could be used to control &quot;tradiional&quot; lighting, and new wall switches enables same kind of functions that Z-Wave was also offering and cheaper as well.s</li>
</ul>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>First of all I bought myself a set of&nbsp;original Philips Hus lightbulbs,3 HUE GO coloured lamps and an iCasa dimmer for the dinner table (controlling tw traditional halogen lightbulbs). The&nbsp;last one made life difficult, as I needed to control these lights not only with an app (family members did not think this was the best method anyway), but also with some sort of wall switch.</p>
<p>So next to the iCasa dimmer I also bought two iCasa Pulase 8S actuators from wifimedia.eu. Both the iCasa dimmer and the Pulse 8S and not &quot;Friends of Hue&quot; compatible, so installation of hese evices may take more time than the original stuff.</p>
