<h1>LamPI</h1>
<p>LamPI is a Home Automation project for switching equipment in the house over 444 MHz senders/transmitters on a RaspberryPI.</p>

<p>As you see, the GUI interface is designed to operate (and manage) all tasks for the connected devices and minimize the need for manual changing of configuration files etc. let alone making configuration changes at compile time.</p>
<p>In case I missed something, please send me an email or make a note on this page. For the moment I'm the only author of LamPI so it can tak a few days before I answer...</p>
<h1>LamPI Introduction</h1>
<p>The goal of my project was to provide an easy interface to the family to ontrol the lights in or house. We had klikaanklikuit.nl switches and we have an iPad (and some Android phones and Laptops) and want to control these switches with an easy-to-use GUI interface. This mean I needed at least 2 components: A component the would control transmitter and receiver and handle low-level device commands, and a GUI in Javascipt/jQuery that would handle the human interaction. In order to store configuration information and for timing commands and unattended use, we need a daemon process that works in the background as well as a database (written in MySQL) to store configuration information.</p>
