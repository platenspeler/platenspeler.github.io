<h1>Temperature/Humidity Sensor WT-440H</h1>
<p><img src="wt-440h.JPG" width="219" height="400" hspace="20" vspace="10" align="left">Some years ago we bought a weather station at a local shop. At that time it was one of the first weather stations with a wireless sensor, but according to todays standards it is nothing special: An indoor unit that displays temperature indoor/outdoor, humidity, sunrise/sunset as well as time. For measuring the outdoor temperature and humidity an external sensor unit was provided, the WT-440H.</p>
<p>After doing some google research it appeared that the sensor unit was manufactured by UPM/Esic. My original unithas to be  at least 15 years old, and probably today there are newer and better units available. However when I searched for WT-440 on eBay I found that even today there are some people selling the sensor unit both as a separate sensors and in combination with a weather station.</p>
<p>The price that you will probably pay is around $ 8.00 for the unit alone excluding shipment to your country.</p>
<p>I decided to buy another 2 remote sensors, as they will work with my small weather station and also provide temperature and humidity readings to my Raspberry PI based LamPI application.</p>
<p>The WT-400H is a basic sensor, it only collects and sends temperature and humidity data to the weather station receiver (or to your Raspberry). However, for a lot of applications this is just good enough. And although this weather station transmitter is designed to work with a matching weather station it will do perfect in and outside the house for gathering temperature and humidity statistics.</p>
<p>As you see on the picture it will isplay temperature and humidity also on a tiny LCD iplay on the sensors unit. In practice though this does not make much sense as I will not walk outside just to read the sensor data...</p>
<h2>What will we do with all the data gathered</h2>
<p>Well, actually the first question would be: Will we store the gathered data for analysis or display at a later moment in time? If we are only interested in the last temperatur of humidity measured than the answer is simple: Just discard everything and we're good to go. But this sounds stupid if we have a computer at hand with close to 16Gb of total storage...</p>
<p>At first I was determined to store all the gathered data into a MSQL database but later I decided that this was overkill and actually made no sense at all!! Alternatively, it make much more sense to store all measured datapoint in a flat file appending every new value as it comes in with a date/time tag. With that, the daemon can store some data on a days/week/months basis and the user can run his/her statistics with the data in the file (rrdtool with optional Excel oxport will do nicely!)<br>
